/* The 'const' keyword doesn't prevent you from editing its mutable values like arrays and objects, but it DOES prevent you from
reassigning the variable identifier to a new value with the assignment operator. See below:

const FRIEND_NAMES = ['Steven', 'Sam', 'Ben']; //Initial declaration

const FRIEND_NAMES = ['Sam', 'Ben', 'Steven']; //This is NOT valid

FRIEND_NAMES[0] = 'Ben'; //This is valid
