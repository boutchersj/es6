//Destructuring arrays in the ES6 version of the ES5 Array.prototype.slice() method
//The commas tab through the indexes, so in this example we're skipping to the 3rd element in the array
//Then using the rest operator we assign everything from the 3rd element to the end of the array to a new variable called 'arr'
//The right side of the assignment operator is where we see the array referenced for this destructuring
