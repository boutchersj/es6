//'use strict' is a phrase you can use to activate Strict Mode, which catches common coding mistakes and 'unsafe' behavior

//The 'const' keyword declares a variable with a constant value that cannot be changed

//Common coding practice is to declare a const variable in all caps with underscores ('_') separating words in the variable name

//Ex: const MY_NEW_CAR = 'Aston Martin'
