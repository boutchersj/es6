//You can use destructuring syntax to destructure an array or list and reassign values to new variables
//Here we swap the values of a and b by using the syntax
//Before the assignment operator is are the variables we want to assign values to
//After the assignment operator are the 2 values IN CORRESPONDING ORDER that will be assigned to those variables
